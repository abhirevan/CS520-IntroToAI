During the times of Pong, Pac-Man and Tetris, Hiroyuki Imabayashi created a complex game that tested the human abilities of planning:
Sokoban - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban.
Many folks are still addicted to solving Sokoban puzzles and you can join them by playing any of the versions freely distributed on the web. The goal is for the human, or robot, to push all the boxes into the desired locations. The robot can move horizontally and vertically and push one box
at a time.

This program encodes the problem configurations of Sokoban using the Planning domain definition language (PDDL). This also contains executable - ff .The FF planning algorithm grounds all action templates by instantiating for all possible com-
binations of matching values
