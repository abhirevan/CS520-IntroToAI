During the times of Pong, Pac-Man and Tetris, Hiroyuki Imabayashi created a complex game that tested the human abilities of planning:
Sokoban - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban.
Many folks are still addicted to solving Sokoban puzzles and you can join them by playing any of the versions freely distributed on the web. The goal is for the human, or robot, to push all the boxes into the desired locations. The robot can move horizontally and vertically and push one box
at a time.
